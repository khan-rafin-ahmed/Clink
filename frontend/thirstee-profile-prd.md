# 🧍‍♂️ Thirstee Profile Page Polish – Phase 6 PRD

## 🎯 Objective

Implement comprehensive profile page layout improvements including equal-height hero columns, enhanced crew cards, content reorganization, and improved visual consistency. Focus on space efficiency, equal heights, and optimal content flow.

---

## ✅ Implemented Improvements

### 🏠 Hero Section Layout Changes

* **Column Ratio**: Changed from 5/12 + 7/12 to equal **50:50 (6/12 + 6/12)** layout
* **Equal Heights**: Both columns use CSS Grid with `items-stretch` for matching heights
* **Responsive Design**: Maintains proper stacking on mobile with appropriate spacing
* **Content Focus**: Right column now contains only primary CTA actions (Create Session + Build Crew)

```html
<div class="grid lg:grid-cols-2 gap-6 lg:gap-8 items-stretch">
  <!-- Left: Profile Info (50%) -->
  <!-- Right: Action Cards (50%) -->
</div>
```

---

### 📱 Content Reorganization

**New Section Order**:
1. **Hero Section** (Profile Info + Action Cards) - 50:50 layout
2. **Next Clink Section** (extracted from hero, now separate)
3. **Stats Section** (4-card layout: Sessions, RSVPs, Crews, Favorite Drink)
4. **Activity Tabs** (Crews and Sessions with timeline layout)

---

### 👑 Crew Card Improvements

* **Equal Heights**: Cards use `h-full flex flex-col` for consistent heights
* **Description Display**: Enhanced typography with `line-clamp-3`, `leading-relaxed`, and `break-words`
* **Empty State Handling**: Shows italic placeholder "No description provided yet..." for crews without descriptions
* **Consolidated Layout**: Avatar stack, member count, and "View Crew →" button on same horizontal line
* **Removed Redundancy**: Eliminated duplicate member count display (previously shown twice)
* **Optimized Spacing**: Reduced excess margins above description section
* **Layout Pattern**: `[Avatar Stack] [X members] ————————————— [View Crew →]` (justified space-between)
* **Avatar Stack**: Shows up to 5 member avatars with `+X` overflow badge
* **Glass Design**: Maintains Apple Liquid Glass aesthetic with hover effects

```html
<Card class="h-full flex flex-col">
  <CardHeader class="flex-shrink-0">...</CardHeader>
  <CardContent class="flex-1 flex flex-col">
    <div class="flex-1"></div> <!-- Spacer -->
    <div class="flex items-center justify-between">
      <span>X total</span>
      <Button>View Crew →</Button>
    </div>
  </CardContent>
</Card>
```

---

### 📊 Stats Section Enhancement

* **Positioning**: Separate section below Next Clink, above Activity Tabs
* **Layout**: 4-card responsive grid (2x2 mobile, 4x1 desktop)
* **Cards**: Sessions, RSVPs, Crews, Favorite Drink (with emoji)
* **Styling**: Consistent glass design with hover effects

---

## 🎨 Design System Compliance

* **Apple Liquid Glass**: Enhanced glassmorphism with translucent cards and depth
* **Masculine Neon Palette**: Deep Amber (#FF7747) primary, Warm Gold (#FFD37E) secondary
* **Micro-interactions**: Hover effects, scale transforms, and smooth transitions
* **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with proper breakpoints
