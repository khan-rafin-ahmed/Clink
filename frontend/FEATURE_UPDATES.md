# Feature Updates

## 1. Compact Tabbed Layout for Profile Events

### Changes Made:
- **File**: `frontend/src/components/EventTabs.tsx`
- **Description**: Updated the tabbed layout to be more compact and centered instead of taking full width
- **Before**: Tabs used `grid w-full grid-cols-2` which made them span the entire width
- **After**: Tabs are now centered with `inline-flex` styling, similar to modern UI patterns

### Visual Changes:
- Tabs are now compact and centered on the page
- Better visual hierarchy and spacing
- More modern appearance matching the screenshot requirements

## 2. Event Ratings Display in Event Details

### New Component:
- **File**: `frontend/src/components/EventRatingBadge.tsx`
- **Description**: A compact rating badge component that displays average rating, stars, and review count
- **Features**:
  - Shows average rating as a number (e.g., "4.5")
  - Displays 5-star rating with filled/half/empty stars
  - Shows review count in parentheses (e.g., "(12)")
  - Responsive sizing (sm, md, lg)
  - Optional info icon
  - Google Reviews-style design

### Integration:
- **File**: `frontend/src/pages/EventDetail.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added import for `EventRatingBadge` component
  - Added import for `getEventRatingStats` function
  - Updated event fetcher to include rating statistics
  - Added rating badge next to event title when ratings exist

### Data Flow:
1. Event details page fetches event data
2. `getEventRatingStats()` calculates average rating and total count from `event_ratings` table
3. Rating data is added to event object (`average_rating`, `total_ratings`)
4. `EventRatingBadge` component displays the rating next to event title
5. Badge only shows when `total_ratings > 0`

## 3. Testing

### Test File:
- **File**: `frontend/src/components/__tests__/EventRatingBadge.test.tsx`
- **Coverage**:
  - Renders rating badge with correct data
  - Handles zero ratings (doesn't render)
  - Tests different sizes
  - Tests optional info icon

## 4. Technical Details

### Database Integration:
- Uses existing `event_ratings` table
- Leverages `getEventRatingStats()` function from `eventRatingService.ts`
- Maintains compatibility with existing rating system

### Performance:
- Rating data is fetched only when needed
- Cached with event data for optimal performance
- No additional database queries for events without ratings

### Responsive Design:
- EventTabs: Responsive on all screen sizes
