# User Profile Events Display - Comprehensive Fix Applied ✅

## Issues Fixed

### ✅ 1. Missing Public Events I Manually Joined
**Problem**: Events where user clicked "Join" and has RSVP record with status 'going' were not showing.
**Solution**: Added queries to fetch events from `rsvps` table where `user_id = current_user` and `status = 'going'`.

### ✅ 2. Missing Events from Crew Membership  
**Problem**: Events user joined through crew membership were not displaying.
**Solution**: Added two types of crew-related event queries:
- **Direct crew invitations**: Events in `event_members` table where `user_id = current_user` and `status = 'accepted'`
- **Crew-associated events**: Events with `crew_id` where user is a member of that crew

### ✅ 3. Missing Host Avatars
**Problem**: Event cards were not displaying host avatar images, even for user's own events.
**Solution**: Enhanced queries to include creator profile data with proper joins to `user_profiles` table.

## Technical Implementation

### Database Queries Added

The fix implements **8 comprehensive queries** to fetch all event categories:

```sql
-- 1 & 2: Events user created (upcoming/past)
SELECT *, creator:user_profiles!events_created_by_fkey(display_name, nickname, avatar_url, user_id)
FROM events WHERE created_by = user.id

-- 3 & 4: Events user RSVP'd to (upcoming/past)  
SELECT *, creator:user_profiles!events_created_by_fkey(...), rsvps!inner(status)
FROM events WHERE rsvps.user_id = user.id AND rsvps.status = 'going'

-- 5 & 6: Events user was directly invited to (upcoming/past)
SELECT *, creator:user_profiles!events_created_by_fkey(...), event_members!inner(status)  
FROM events WHERE event_members.user_id = user.id AND event_members.status = 'accepted'

-- 7 & 8: Events associated with user's crews (upcoming/past)
SELECT *, creator:user_profiles!events_created_by_fkey(...)
FROM events WHERE crew_id IN (user's crew IDs)
```

### Data Processing Features

1. **Deduplication Logic**: Prevents duplicate events when user appears in multiple categories
2. **Creator Data Handling**: Properly processes joined user profile data for avatars
3. **Hosting Status Detection**: Correctly identifies which events user is hosting vs attending
4. **Proper Sorting**: Upcoming events by date ascending, past events by date descending

### Event Categories Now Included

✅ **Events I Created** - Both public and private events hosted by the user  
✅ **Events I Joined via RSVP** - Public events where user manually clicked "Join"  
✅ **Events I Was Invited To** - Direct invitations via `event_members` table  
✅ **Events from My Crews** - Events associated with crews user belongs to  

## Avatar Display Fix

### Before:
- No host avatars showing on event cards
- Generic fallback text only

### After:  
- ✅ **Host avatars display correctly** using `user_profiles.avatar_url`
- ✅ **Google avatar fallback** when custom avatar not set
- ✅ **Proper display names** using `display_name` or `nickname`
- ✅ **Consistent avatar sizing** across all event cards

## Code Changes Made

### File: `frontend/src/pages/UserProfile.tsx`

**Key Changes:**
1. **Replaced simple queries** with comprehensive 8-query approach
2. **Added crew membership lookup** to find user's crews
3. **Enhanced data joins** to include creator profile information  
4. **Implemented deduplication** to prevent duplicate events
5. **Added proper error handling** for all query results
6. **Improved data transformation** for EventCard compatibility

**Lines Modified:** 111-342 (complete rewrite of event fetching logic)

## Testing Verification

### ✅ Compilation Success
- No TypeScript errors
- Application builds and runs successfully
- All imports and dependencies resolved

### ✅ Data Structure Compatibility  
- Events properly formatted for `EventCard` component
- Creator data includes required fields: `display_name`, `avatar_url`, `user_id`
- Hosting status correctly identified with `isHosting` flag

## Expected Results

After this fix, the user profile page should display:

### Upcoming Events Tab:
- ✅ Events you created with future dates
- ✅ Public events you RSVP'd to with future dates  
- ✅ Events you were invited to with future dates
- ✅ Future events from crews you belong to
- ✅ Host avatars visible on all event cards
- ✅ Proper "Hosted by You" vs "Hosted by [Name]" labels

### Past Events Tab:
- ✅ All the same categories but for past dates
- ✅ Sorted by most recent first
- ✅ Proper pagination if many events

### Host Actions:
- ✅ Edit/Delete buttons only show for events you created
- ✅ "Hosted by You" label for your events
- ✅ "Hosted by [Name]" for events you joined

## No Breaking Changes

- ✅ Maintains compatibility with existing `EventCard` component
- ✅ Preserves all existing functionality  
- ✅ Uses established database schema without modifications
- ✅ Follows existing code patterns and conventions

## Performance Considerations

- **Parallel Queries**: All 8 queries run in parallel using `Promise.all()`
- **Efficient Joins**: Uses Supabase's built-in join syntax for optimal performance
- **Minimal Data**: Only fetches required fields for display
- **Caching**: Maintains existing cache invalidation logic

The fix is comprehensive, efficient, and maintains full backward compatibility while solving all the identified issues with event display and avatar visibility.
