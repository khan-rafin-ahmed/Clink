# Profile and Notifications Implementation

## Features Implemented

### 1. ✅ Enhanced "Your Coming Hell" Section

**Problem**: Profile page only showed events you created, not events you're attending.

**Solution**: Now shows **all events you're involved in**:
- ✅ **Events you're hosting** (created by you)
- ✅ **Events you RSVP'd to** (public events via rsvps table)
- ✅ **Events you're invited to** (private events via event_members table)

**Changes Made**:
- Updated `UserProfile.tsx` to fetch from multiple sources
- Added deduplication logic to avoid showing same event twice
- Updated UI to show different actions based on hosting vs attending
- Changed section title from "Your Upcoming Hell" to "Your Coming Hell"
- Added subtitle: "Events you're hosting and attending"

### 2. ✅ Private Event Invitation Notifications

**Problem**: No notification system for private event invitations.

**Solution**: Complete notification system for event invitations:
- ✅ **Database trigger** creates notifications when users are invited
- ✅ **NotificationCenter UI** shows invitation notifications
- ✅ **Accept/Decline buttons** for responding to invitations
- ✅ **Automatic status updates** when responding

**Changes Made**:
- Created `add_event_invitation_notifications.sql` database trigger
- Enhanced `NotificationCenter.tsx` with event invitation handling
- Added `respondToEventInvitation()` function to `eventService.ts`
- Integrated notification system into navbar (already existed)

### 3. ✅ Crews Display (Already Working)

**Status**: Crews are already properly displayed in the profile page.
- ✅ Shows crews you're a member of
- ✅ Shows crew roles and status
- ✅ Proper crew navigation and management

## Technical Implementation

### Database Changes

#### Event Invitation Notifications Trigger
```sql
-- Creates notifications when users are invited to private events
CREATE TRIGGER event_invitation_notification_trigger
    AFTER INSERT ON event_members
    FOR EACH ROW
    WHEN (NEW.status = 'pending')
    EXECUTE FUNCTION handle_event_invitation_notification();
```

#### Notification Data Structure
```json
{
  "event_id": "uuid",
  "event_member_id": "uuid", 
  "inviter_id": "uuid",
  "event_title": "Event Name"
}
```

### Frontend Changes

#### UserProfile.tsx - Enhanced Event Fetching
```typescript
// Now fetches from 5 sources instead of 2:
const [
  upcomingHostedResult,     // Events you're hosting
  upcomingRSVPResult,       // Events you RSVP'd to  
  upcomingInvitedResult,    // Events you're invited to
  pastHostedResult,         // Past events you hosted
  pastAttendingResult       // Past events you attended
] = await Promise.all([...])
```

#### NotificationCenter.tsx - Event Invitations
```typescript
// New event invitation response handler
const handleEventInvitationResponse = async (
  notificationId: string, 
  eventMemberId: string, 
  response: 'accepted' | 'declined'
) => {
  await respondToEventInvitation(eventMemberId, response)
  // Updates UI and shows success message
}
```

#### eventService.ts - New Function
```typescript
// Respond to event invitation
export async function respondToEventInvitation(
  eventMemberId: string, 
  response: 'accepted' | 'declined'
) {
  // Updates event_members table with user's response
}
```

## User Experience Flow

### Private Event Invitation Flow
1. **Host creates private event** and invites users
2. **Database trigger fires** → Creates notification
3. **Invitee sees notification** in navbar bell icon
4. **Invitee clicks notification** → Opens notification center
5. **Invitee sees invitation** with Accept/Decline buttons
6. **Invitee responds** → Updates database and removes notification
7. **If accepted** → Event appears in "Your Coming Hell"

### Profile Page Experience
1. **"Your Coming Hell"** shows all upcoming events:
   - Events you're hosting (with edit/delete options)
   - Events you're attending (view-only)
   - Events you're invited to (view-only)
2. **"Your Past Hell"** shows completed events from all sources
3. **"Your Crews"** shows crew memberships (already working)

## Files Modified

### Database
- ✅ `add_event_invitation_notifications.sql` - New trigger for notifications

### Frontend
- ✅ `frontend/src/pages/UserProfile.tsx` - Enhanced event fetching
- ✅ `frontend/src/components/NotificationCenter.tsx` - Event invitation handling
