# Event Creation Critical Issues - Fixes Applied

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### Issue 1: Event Date/Time Classification Bug ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Events created with future dates (6+ days) were appearing in "Past Events" tab instead of "Upcoming Events" tab.

**Root Cause**: Timezone handling inconsistency between event creation and profile page filtering logic.

**Fix Applied**:
1. **Frontend Fix** (`frontend/src/pages/UserProfile.tsx`):
   - Updated date comparison logic to use consistent UTC timezone handling
   - Simplified to use direct UTC timestamp:
     ```javascript
     const nowUTC = new Date().toISOString()
     ```
   - Updated all date comparisons to use `nowUTC` for consistency

2. **Database Fix** (`supabase/migrations/fix_event_date_timezone_and_crew_invites.sql`):
   - Updated `get_user_accessible_events` function to use proper timezone handling
   - Changed all date comparisons to use `NOW() AT TIME ZONE 'UTC'`

### Issue 2: Crew Invitation Not Working ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Crew members invited during event creation couldn't see the events in their account.

**Root Cause**: Profile page queries were missing events where user is an `event_member` with status 'accepted'.

**Fix Applied**:
1. **Frontend Fix** (`frontend/src/pages/UserProfile.tsx`):
   - Added new queries to fetch crew-invited events:
     ```javascript
     // Events user was invited to via crew (upcoming)
     supabase.from('events').select(`*, event_members!inner(status)`)
       .eq('event_members.user_id', user.id)
       .eq('event_members.status', 'accepted')
       .neq('created_by', user.id)
       .gte('date_time', nowUTC)
     ```
   - Added deduplication logic to prevent duplicate events when user appears in multiple categories
   - Updated both upcoming and past event fetching logic

2. **Database Fix** (`supabase/migrations/fix_event_date_timezone_and_crew_invites.sql`):
   - Enhanced `get_user_accessible_events` function to include crew-invited events
   - Added proper UNION clause for events where user is in `event_members` table with status 'accepted'

## Files Modified

### Frontend Changes
- `frontend/src/pages/UserProfile.tsx` - Fixed date comparison and added crew invitation queries

### Database Changes
- `supabase/migrations/fix_event_date_timezone_and_crew_invites.sql` - New migration file with fixes

## How to Apply the Database Migration

Since this project uses hosted Supabase, apply the migration manually:

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard** → Your Project → SQL Editor
2. **Run the migration** from `supabase/migrations/fix_event_date_timezone_and_crew_invites.sql`
3. **Verify the function** was updated by checking the Database → Functions section

## Testing Instructions

### Test Issue 1 (Date Classification):
1. Create a new event with a date 6+ days in the future
2. Go to your profile page
3. **Expected**: Event should appear in "Upcoming Events" tab
4. **Previously**: Event would incorrectly appear in "Past Events" tab

### Test Issue 2 (Crew Invitations):
1. Create a crew with multiple members
2. Create a new event and invite the crew during creation
3. Log in as a crew member who was invited
4. Go to profile page
5. **Expected**: Event should appear in "Upcoming Events" tab
6. **Previously**: Event would not appear at all for crew members

## Additional Improvements Made

1. **Deduplication Logic**: Added logic to prevent duplicate events when a user appears in multiple categories (e.g., both RSVP'd and crew-invited to same event)

2. **Consistent Timezone Handling**: All date comparisons now use consistent UTC timezone handling

3. **Enhanced Database Function**: The `get_user_accessible_events` function now properly handles all event access scenarios

## Verification

After applying the fixes:
- Events should be correctly classified as upcoming/past based on their actual date/time
- Crew members should see events they were invited to during event creation
- No duplicate events should appear in profile tabs
- All timezone-related date issues should be resolved

## Next Steps

1. Apply the database migration
2. Test both scenarios described above
3. Monitor for any remaining date/time classification issues
4. Verify crew invitation workflow works end-to-end
